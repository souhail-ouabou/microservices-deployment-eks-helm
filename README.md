# DevOps with EKS, Kubernetes, AWS, Helm, Terraform, and CI/CD

This project demonstrates my expertise in a broad range of DevOps practices and tools. It focuses on deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters on AWS EKS, using Helm for application deployments, configuring CI/CD pipelines with GitLab, and implementing disaster recovery with Velero. Additionally, it includes managing persistent storage with AWS EBS, ensuring efficient data protection and backup strategies.

## Project Overview



In this project, I delve into various aspects of DevOps and demonstrate my expertise in utilizing the following key technologies:

**Kubernetes on AWS:** I deployed Kubernetes on AWS using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), which is widely recognized for its scalability and reliability in managing Kubernetes clusters.

**Helm:** Helm, a Kubernetes package manager, plays a key role in simplifying the deployment and management of applications by enabling reusable, version-controlled charts.

**CI/CD with GitLab:** I developed robust CI/CD pipelines using GitLab, starting with a simple CI pipeline and gradually enhancing it with continuous delivery and deployment practices, leveraging GitLabâ€™s powerful DevOps features.

**Infrastructure as Code with Terraform:** I used Terraform to define and manage AWS infrastructure as code. This approach enables efficient provisioning, scaling, and version control of AWS resources, streamlining infrastructure management.

**Disaster Recovery and Data Protection:** I implemented disaster recovery and data protection strategies, including AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume snapshots and the use of Velero, a third-party tool. This ensures data protection and business continuity in case of failure.
